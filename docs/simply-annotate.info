  2. Press ‘M-s SPC’
  3. Use the full annotation buffer for detailed notes
  4. Press ‘C-x C-q’ to enter edit mode if needed
  5. Save with ‘C-c C-c’

4.3 Viewing Annotations
=======================

When ‘simply-annotate-mode’ is active:

   • Annotated text is highlighted with a colored background
   • The header line shows annotation count and available commands
   • Moving to the next and previous annotation displays the annotation
     if the *Annotations* buffer is currently active
   • Press ‘M-s SPC’ on annotated text to view in detail

4.4 Editing Annotations
=======================

To edit an existing annotation:

  1. Place cursor on annotated text
  2. Press ‘M-s SPC’ to open the annotation buffer
  3. Press ‘C-x C-q’ to enter edit mode
  4. Make your changes
  5. Save with ‘C-c C-c’ or cancel with ‘C-c C-k’

5 Navigation
************

5.1 Moving Between Annotations
==============================

Simply Annotate provides convenient commands for navigation:

‘M-n’
     ‘simply-annotate-next’ - Jump to next annotation
‘M-p’
     ‘simply-annotate-previous’ - Jump to previous annotation

   These commands automatically wrap around, so you can continuously
navigate through all annotations in a buffer.

5.2 Viewing Current Annotation
==============================

When you're on an annotated region, you can:

   • View the annotation content in the header line
   • Press ‘M-s SPC’ to open the detailed annotation buffer
   • See the annotation count and position in the header line

   • Clickable links to jump to each annotation

6.2 Cross-file Annotation Browsing
==================================

To browse annotations across all files:

     M-s 0

   This command:
   • Shows a completion list of all files with annotations
   • Displays the annotation count for each file
   • Opens the selected file and shows its annotations
   • Uses grep-mode format for easy navigation

6.3 Annotation Buffer Features
==============================

The annotation buffer provides a rich editing environment:

8 Customization
***************

8.1 Basic Configuration
=======================

     (use-package simply-annotate
       :ensure t
       :config
       ;; Customize the highlight face
       (setq simply-annotate-highlight-face 'highlight)

       ;; Customize storage location
       (setq simply-annotate-file
             (expand-file-name "my-annotations.el" user-emacs-directory))

       ;; Customize annotation buffer height
       (setq simply-annotate-buffer-height 0.4)

       :bind
       ("C-c A" . simply-annotate-mode))

8.2 Customization Variables
===========================

‘simply-annotate-file’
     File to store annotations.  Default:
     ‘~/.emacs.d/simply-annotations.el’

‘simply-annotate-highlight-face’
     Face for highlighted annotated text.  Default: ‘'highlight’

‘simply-annotate-buffer-name’
     Name of the annotation display buffer.  Default: ‘"*Annotation*"’

‘simply-annotate-buffer-height’
     Height of annotation buffer as fraction of frame height.  Default:
     ‘0.3’

8.3 Custom Faces
================

You can define custom faces for annotation highlights:

     ;; Custom highlight face for annotations
     (defface my-annotation-face
       '((t :background "lightyellow" :foreground "black"))
       "Face for annotation highlights")

     (setq simply-annotate-highlight-face 'my-annotation-face)


File: simply-annotate.info,  Node: Data Storage,  Next: Troubleshooting,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Top

9 Data Storage
**************

9.1 Storage Format
==================

Annotations are stored in a single Emacs Lisp file (by default
‘~/.emacs.d/simply-annotations.el’).  The format is human-readable and
can be version controlled if desired.

9.2 Sample Storage Format
=========================

     ;;; Simply Annotate Database
     ;;; This file is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.

     (("simply-annotate:/path/to/file.el"
       ((start . 1250) (end . 1300) (text . "This needs refactoring"))
       ((start . 2100) (end . 2150) (text . "Add error handling here")))
      ("simply-annotate:/path/to/other-file.py"
       ((start . 450) (end . 500) (text . "Performance bottleneck"))))

9.3 Data Management
===================

   • The database file is automatically created when first needed
   • Annotations are saved automatically when buffers are saved or
     killed
   • The file uses a namespace prefix to avoid conflicts
   • Empty databases are automatically cleaned up


File: simply-annotate.info,  Node: Troubleshooting,  Next: Function Index,  Prev: Data Storage,  Up: Top

10 Troubleshooting
******************

10.1 Annotations Not Persisting
===============================

If your annotations aren't being saved between sessions:

   • Check that ‘simply-annotate-file’ is writable
   • Ensure annotation mode is properly enabled
   • Verify that hooks are installed correctly
   • Check file permissions on the storage directory

10.2 Performance with Large Files
=================================

Simply Annotate is designed to be lightweight:

   • Annotations use lightweight overlays
   • No performance impact on file operations
   • Consider splitting very large annotation sets across multiple files

10.3 Integration Issues
=======================

   • Annotations work with most major modes
   • Compatible with ‘lsp-mode’, ‘flycheck’, and other packages
   • May need customization for exotic display modes
   • Check for conflicting key bindings

10.4 Common Error Messages
==========================

*"No annotation at point"*
     You're trying to edit or remove an annotation, but the cursor isn't
     positioned on annotated text.

*"Annotation cancelled/removed"*
     You saved an empty annotation, which automatically removes it.

*Database file errors*
     Check permissions and disk space for the storage file location.
