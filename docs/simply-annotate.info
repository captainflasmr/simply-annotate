4 Basic Usage
*************

4.1 Enabling Annotation Mode
============================

To start using annotations in a buffer, enable the minor mode:

     M-x simply-annotate-mode

   You can also bind this to a convenient key:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c A") 'simply-annotate-mode)

4.2 Creating Annotations
========================

4.2.1 Smart Action Command
--------------------------

The ‘M-s j’ command (‘simply-annotate-smart-action’) is context-aware
and behaves differently depending on the situation:

*With region selected*
     Creates new annotation or edits existing one at the selected text
*On annotated text (no region)*
     Toggles annotation buffer visibility to show/hide the annotation
*With prefix argument (‘C-u M-s j’)*
     Forces edit mode on existing annotation
*Elsewhere (no region, no annotation)*
     Creates annotation for the current line

4.2.2 Traditional Method
------------------------

For more explicit control:

  1. Select the region you want to annotate
  2. Press ‘M-s j’
  3. Enter your annotation text in the dedicated buffer
  4. Save with ‘C-c C-c’

4.2.3 Multi-line Annotations
----------------------------

The annotation buffer supports full multi-line editing:

  1. Select the region you want to annotate
  2. Press ‘M-s j’
  3. Use the full annotation buffer for detailed notes
  4. Format your text as needed (multiple paragraphs, bullet points,
     etc.)
  5. Save with ‘C-c C-c’

4.3 Viewing Annotations
=======================

When ‘simply-annotate-mode’ is active:

   • Annotated text is displayed according to your chosen display style
   • The header line shows annotation count and available commands
   • Thread status and comment count displayed in header (e.g.,
     ‘[OPEN/HIGH:3]’)
   • Moving to annotated text shows annotation details in the header
   • Press ‘M-s j’ on annotated text to view/edit in detail

4.4 Editing Annotations
=======================

To edit an existing annotation:

  1. Place cursor on annotated text
  2. Press ‘M-s j’ to open the annotation buffer
  3. Make your changes directly (the buffer starts in edit mode)
  4. Save with ‘C-c C-c’ or cancel with ‘C-c C-k’

4.5 Deleting Annotations
========================

To remove an annotation:

  1. Place cursor on annotated text
  2. Press ‘M-s -’ to remove the annotation

   Alternatively, you can edit the annotation and delete all text, then
save with ‘C-c C-c’ to remove it.

5 Advanced Editing
******************

5.1 Raw Sexp Editing
====================

For complete control over annotation data structures, Simply Annotate
provides raw sexp editing capabilities.  This allows power users to
directly manipulate the underlying Elisp data structure that stores
annotation information.

5.1.1 Entering Sexp Edit Mode
-----------------------------

To edit an annotation's raw data structure:

  1. Place cursor on any annotation
  2. Press ‘M-s e’ to open the raw sexp editor
  3. Edit the Elisp data structure directly
  4. Save with ‘C-c C-c’ or cancel with ‘C-c C-k’

5.1.2 Sexp Structure
--------------------

Annotations are stored as Elisp association lists with the following
structure:

     ((id . "thread-123456")
      (created . "2025-06-29T10:30:00")
      (status . "open")
      (priority . "high")
      (tags . ("bug" "critical"))
      (comments . (((author . "John Doe")
                    (timestamp . "2025-06-29T10:30:00")
                    (text . "Found a critical bug here")
                    (type . "comment"))
                   ((author . "Jane Smith")
                    (timestamp . "2025-06-29T11:15:00")
                    (text . "I can reproduce this issue")
                    (type . "reply")))))

5.1.3 Required Fields
---------------------

‘id’
     Unique identifier for the thread (string)
‘created’
     ISO timestamp when thread was created
‘status’
     Current status (‘"open"’, ‘"in-progress"’, ‘"resolved"’,
     ‘"closed"’)
‘priority’
     Priority level (‘"low"’, ‘"normal"’, ‘"high"’, ‘"critical"’)
‘tags’
     List of tag strings (can be empty list)
‘comments’
     List of comment/reply objects

5.1.4 Comment Structure
-----------------------

Each comment in the ‘comments’ list must have:

‘author’
     Author name (string)
‘timestamp’
     ISO timestamp when comment was created
‘text’
     The actual comment text content
‘type’
     Either ‘"comment"’ (original) or ‘"reply"’

5.1.5 Sexp Editing Features
---------------------------

The sexp editor provides:

   • *Syntax highlighting*: Key fields and values are highlighted
   • *Helpful comments*: Guidance about structure and valid values
   • *Validation*: Ensures required fields are present when saving
   • *Error handling*: Clear error messages for invalid structures
   • *Auto-completion*: Missing fields are added with defaults

5.1.6 Use Cases for Sexp Editing
--------------------------------

   • *Bulk operations*: Modify multiple comments at once
   • *Data migration*: Copy annotation structures between files
   • *Precision control*: Manually adjust timestamps or IDs
   • *Complex threading*: Create reply structures not possible through
     UI
   • *Metadata manipulation*: Bulk change authors, statuses, or
     priorities
   • *Import/export*: Transform annotations for external tools

5.1.7 Safety and Best Practices
-------------------------------

   • Always use ‘C-c C-k’ to cancel if unsure about changes
   • Ensure proper Elisp syntax with balanced parentheses
   • Use ISO timestamp format: ‘"2025-06-29T10:30:00"’
   • Keep ‘type’ field as ‘"comment"’ or ‘"reply"’
   • Preserve required fields (‘id’, ‘comments’, etc.)
   • Test complex changes on a backup first

6 Threading and Collaboration
*****************************

Lets create a thread!, reply and add in authors

6.1 Threading System
====================

Each annotation can become a threaded conversation with multiple
replies.  This is perfect for code reviews, collaborative editing, and
ongoing discussions about specific parts of your code or documents.

6.1.1 Adding Replies
--------------------

To add a reply to any annotation:

  1. Place cursor on annotated text
  2. Press ‘M-s r’
  3. Enter your reply text
  4. The annotation automatically becomes a threaded conversation

6.1.2 Thread Display
--------------------

Threaded annotations are displayed with rich formatting:

     ┌─ Thread: thread-123456 [OPEN/HIGH] Tags: review, urgent (3 authors)
     │ 💬 John Doe (06/19 09:49):
     │   This needs review before release
     │ ↳ Jane Smith (06/19 10:15):

  1. Place cursor on annotated text
  2. Press ‘M-s t’ to add a tag
  3. Enter a tag like ‘review’, ‘bug’, ‘question’, etc.
  4. Tags appear as ‘#review #bug’ in the annotation display

6.3 Multi-Author Support
========================

6.3.1 Author Configuration
--------------------------

Configure team members and prompting behavior:

     ;; Single user (default behavior)
     (setq simply-annotate-prompt-for-author nil)

     ;; Team collaboration
     (setq simply-annotate-author-list '("John Doe" "Jane Smith" "Bob Wilson"))
     (setq simply-annotate-prompt-for-author 'threads-only)  ; Prompt only for replies
     (setq simply-annotate-remember-author-per-file t)       ; Remember per file

6.3.2 Prompting Modes
---------------------

‘nil’
     Never prompt (single-user mode) - default behavior
‘'first-only’
     Prompt once per session, then remember choice
‘'always’
     Prompt for every annotation and reply
‘'threads-only’
     Prompt only when adding replies (great for code reviews)

6.3.3 Author Management Commands
--------------------------------

‘M-s a’
     ‘simply-annotate-change-annotation-author’ - Change author of
     existing annotation/comment
‘M-s A’
     ‘simply-annotate-reset-session-author’ - Reset session author
     (forces prompt on next annotation)

6.4 Collaboration Workflows
===========================

6.4.1 Code Review Workflow
--------------------------

  1. *Reviewer* creates annotations on problematic code sections
  2. Set priority with ‘M-s p’ (high for blocking issues)
  3. Add relevant tags with ‘M-s t’ (‘#security’, ‘#performance’,
     ‘#style’)
  4. *Developer* adds replies with ‘M-s r’ explaining or asking
     questions
  5. *Reviewer* responds with additional context or approval
  6. Mark as resolved with ‘M-s s’ when fixed
  7. Export final review with ‘M-s o’ to org-mode for documentation

6.4.2 Document Collaboration
----------------------------

  1. *Author* writes draft document
  2. *Reviewers* add annotations with feedback using different author
     names
  3. Track status of each feedback item with ‘M-s s’
  4. Use ‘M-s l’ to get overview of all feedback
  5. Export to org-mode with ‘M-s o’ for final review meeting
  6. Archive resolved items, keep open ones visible

7 Display Styles
****************

Simply Annotate supports three different ways to display annotations,
allowing you to choose the visual style that best fits your workflow.

7.1 Available Styles
====================

‘highlight’
     Traditional background highlighting of annotated text (good for
     emphasis)
‘fringe’
     Shows small indicators in the left fringe (minimal visual impact)
‘both’
     Combines both highlighting and fringe indicators (maximum
     visibility)

7.2 Changing Display Styles
===========================

You can change the display style in several ways:

   • Press ‘M-s ]’ to cycle through all three styles
   • Set ‘simply-annotate-display-style’ in your configuration
   • Use ‘simply-annotate-update-display-style’ to refresh existing
     annotations

7.3 Style Recommendations
=========================

*Code Review*
     Use ‘fringe’ style to avoid visual clutter while coding
*Research and Documentation*
     Use ‘highlight’ style for emphasis on important passages
*Critical Files*
     Use ‘both’ style for maximum visibility of important annotations
*Threading Display*
     All styles work well with threaded annotations and status
     indicators

7.4 Fringe Customization
========================

The fringe display can be customized:

   • Choose different symbols: ‘left-triangle’, ‘right-triangle’,
     ‘filled-rectangle’, or ‘custom’
   • Customize colors with ‘simply-annotate-fringe-face’
   • Define custom bitmaps for unique indicators


File: simply-annotate.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Advanced Features,  Prev: Display Styles,  Up: Top

8 Navigation
************

8.1 Moving Between Annotations
==============================

Simply Annotate provides convenient commands for navigation:

‘M-n’
     ‘simply-annotate-next’ - Jump to next annotation
‘M-p’
     ‘simply-annotate-previous’ - Jump to previous annotation

   These commands automatically wrap around, so you can continuously
navigate through all annotations in a buffer.  When you arrive at an
annotation, the text is briefly highlighted with a pulse effect.

8.2 Viewing Current Annotation
==============================

When you're on an annotated region, you can:

   • View the annotation content in the header line
   • See thread status, priority, and comment count (e.g.,
     ‘[OPEN/HIGH:3]’)
   • Press ‘M-s j’ to open the detailed annotation buffer
   • See the annotation count and position (e.g., "2/5") in the header
     line
   • View available keybindings in the header line

8.3 Smart Navigation
====================

The navigation commands work intelligently with different display styles
and threading:

   • In ‘highlight’ mode: jumps to the exact annotated text
   • In ‘fringe’ mode: finds annotations anywhere on the current line
   • Shows appropriate message for simple or threaded annotations
   • Always shows a visual pulse when arriving at the annotation
   • Thread summary displayed for complex annotations

11.3 Smart Action Behavior
==========================

The ‘M-s j’ key binding changes behavior based on context:

Context                Behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Region selected        Create new annotation or edit existing
On annotation (no      Toggle annotation buffer visibility
region)
‘C-u M-s j’ on         Force edit mode
annotation
Elsewhere              Create annotation for current line

11.4 Sexp Editing Mode
======================

When in sexp editing mode (after ‘M-s e’):

Key         Command                       Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘C-c C-c’   ‘simply-annotate-save-annotation-buffer’Parse and save sexp
‘C-c C-k’   ‘simply-annotate-cancel-edit’ Cancel sexp editing
‘C-g’       ‘simply-annotate-cancel-edit’ Cancel sexp editing
                                          (alternative)

   The sexp editing buffer provides:
   • Emacs Lisp mode for syntax highlighting
   • Helpful comments explaining the data structure
   • Pretty-printed formatting for readability
   • Validation when saving to ensure data integrity

File: simply-annotate.info,  Node: Data Storage,  Next: Troubleshooting,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Top

13 Data Storage
***************

13.1 Storage Format
===================

Annotations are stored in a single Emacs Lisp file (by default
‘~/.emacs.d/simply-annotations.el’).  The format is human-readable and
can be version controlled if desired.

13.2 Sample Storage Format
==========================

With threading support, the storage format includes complete thread
structures:

     ;;; Simply Annotate Database
     ;;; This file is auto-generated. Do not edit manually.

     (("simply-annotate:/path/to/file.el"
       ((start . 1250) (end . 1300)
        (text . ((id . "thread-123456")
                 (created . "2025-06-29T10:30:00")
                 (status . "open")
                 (priority . "high")
                 (tags . ("review" "urgent"))
                 (comments . (((author . "John Doe")
                               (timestamp . "2025-06-29T10:30:00")
                               (text . "This needs refactoring")
                               (type . "comment"))
                              ((author . "Jane Smith")
                               (timestamp . "2025-06-29T10:45:00")
                               (text . "I agree, will fix this")
                               (type . "reply")))))))
       ((start . 2100) (end . 2150)
        (text . "Add error handling here")))
      ("simply-annotate:/path/to/other-file.py"
       ((start . 450) (end . 500)
        (text . "Performance bottleneck"))))

13.3 Data Structure Evolution
=============================

Simply Annotate supports both legacy string annotations and new thread
structures:

   • *Legacy format*: Simple strings are automatically converted to
     thread structures when edited
   • *Thread format*: Complete data structures with metadata and
     conversation history
   • *Backward compatibility*: Old annotations continue to work
     seamlessly
   • *Migration*: Annotations are upgraded to thread format when
     modified

13.4 Data Management
====================

   • The database file is automatically created when first needed
   • Annotations are saved automatically when buffers are saved or
     killed
   • The file uses a file key system to track annotations per file
   • Empty databases are automatically cleaned up
   • Only saves when there are actual changes to annotations
   • Thread structures are validated when saving to prevent corruption

13.5 File Key System
====================

Each file is identified by a unique key:
   • Uses the full file path for file-visiting buffers
   • Uses the buffer name for non-file buffers
   • Ensures annotations persist across Emacs sessions
   • Supports moving files (annotations follow the buffer name)

13.6 Sexp Editing and Data Integrity
====================================

When using sexp editing mode:

   • Data structures are validated before saving
   • Required fields are automatically added if missing
   • Malformed structures are rejected with helpful error messages
   • Backup functionality preserves data before dangerous operations
   • Thread IDs and timestamps are preserved across edits


File: simply-annotate.info,  Node: Troubleshooting,  Next: Function Index,  Prev: Data Storage,  Up: Top

14 Troubleshooting
******************

14.1 Annotations Not Persisting
===============================

If your annotations aren't being saved between sessions:

   • Check that ‘simply-annotate-file’ is writable
   • Ensure annotation mode is properly enabled
   • Verify that hooks are installed correctly
   • Check file permissions on the storage directory
   • Look for error messages in the ‘*Messages*’ buffer
   • Verify threading data structure isn't corrupted

14.2 Display Issues
===================

14.2.1 Highlighting Not Visible
-------------------------------

   • Customize ‘simply-annotate-highlight-face’ for your color theme
   • Check for conflicting overlays from other packages
   • Try switching to fringe mode: ‘(setq simply-annotate-display-style
     'fringe)’
   • Verify the face definition with ‘M-x describe-face’

14.2.2 Fringe Indicators Not Showing
------------------------------------

   • Ensure your Emacs build supports fringe bitmaps
   • Check that fringe is visible: ‘(set-window-fringes nil 8 8)’
   • Try a different fringe indicator: ‘(setq
     simply-annotate-fringe-indicator 'left-triangle)’
   • Verify fringe face colors are visible against your theme

14.3 Smart Action Issues
========================

   • Remember the command is context-sensitive - behavior changes based
     on region selection and cursor position
   • Use ‘C-u M-s j’ to force edit mode on existing annotations
   • Check if you're properly positioned on annotated text (especially
     in fringe mode)
   • Verify the annotation buffer is responding to ‘C-c C-c’ and ‘C-c
     C-k’

14.4 Threading Issues
=====================

14.4.1 Author Prompting Problems
--------------------------------

   • Check ‘simply-annotate-prompt-for-author’ setting
   • Verify ‘simply-annotate-author-list’ contains valid names
   • Use ‘M-s A’ to reset session author if stuck
   • Check that prompting mode matches your workflow needs

14.4.2 Thread Display Corruption
--------------------------------

   • Try ‘M-s ]’ to refresh display style
   • Check for malformed thread data structures
   • Use sexp editing mode to inspect and fix thread structure
   • Verify all required fields are present in thread data

14.4.3 Reply Issues
-------------------

   • Ensure you're using ‘C-c C-c’ to save replies properly
   • Check that ‘M-s r’ is working on existing annotations
   • Verify author configuration for multi-user workflows
   • Look for timestamp or author field corruption

14.5 Sexp Editing Issues
========================

14.5.1 Parsing Errors
---------------------

   • Ensure proper Elisp syntax with balanced parentheses
   • Check that all strings are properly quoted
   • Verify required fields (id, comments) are present
   • Use ‘C-c C-k’ to cancel if unsure about changes

14.5.2 Data Structure Problems
------------------------------

   • Check timestamp format: use ISO format ‘"2025-06-29T10:30:00"’
   • Ensure comment ‘type’ field is ‘"comment"’ or ‘"reply"’
   • Verify ‘status’ and ‘priority’ values are from allowed lists
   • Confirm ‘tags’ field is a list, even if empty: ‘()’

14.5.3 Validation Failures
--------------------------

   • Thread structure must be an association list with required keys
   • ‘comments’ field must be a list of comment objects
   • Each comment must have ‘author’, ‘timestamp’, ‘text’, and ‘type’
   • Use the helpful comments in sexp editing mode as a guide

14.6 Performance with Large Files
=================================

Simply Annotate is designed to be lightweight:

   • Annotations use lightweight overlays
   • No performance impact on file operations
   • Fringe mode generally has better performance than highlight mode
   • Sexp editing may be slower with very large annotation structures
   • Consider splitting very large annotation sets across multiple files

14.7 Integration Issues
=======================

   • Annotations work with most major modes
   • Compatible with ‘lsp-mode’, ‘flycheck’, and other packages
   • May need customization for exotic display modes
   • Check for conflicting key bindings with ‘C-h k’
   • Fringe indicators work well with line number modes
   • Sexp editing works in any buffer that supports Emacs Lisp editing

14.8 Buffer-Local Variable Issues
=================================

If annotations disappear when opening new files:

   • Ensure buffer-local variables are properly declared
   • Check that ‘simply-annotate-overlays’ is buffer-local
   • Verify mode activation is working correctly per buffer
   • Use debug functions to check overlay state

14.9 Common Error Messages
==========================

*"No annotation at point"*
     You're trying to edit or remove an annotation, but the cursor isn't
     positioned on annotated text.  In fringe mode, make sure you're on
     the correct line.

*"Annotation cancelled/removed"*
     You saved an empty annotation, which automatically removes it.

*"No annotations in buffer"*
     The current buffer has no annotations to navigate or list.

*"No annotations database found"*
     No annotation file exists yet.  Create your first annotation to
     initialize the database.

*"Invalid annotation format: must be a thread alist"*
     Sexp editing validation failed.  Check the data structure format
     and required fields.

*"Error parsing sexp"*
     The Elisp syntax in sexp editing mode is invalid.  Check for
     balanced parentheses and proper quoting.

*Database file errors*
     Check permissions and disk space for the storage file location.

14.10 Getting Help
==================

   • Use ‘C-h k’ followed by a key binding to see what command it runs
   • Check the ‘*Messages*’ buffer for error messages
   • Use ‘M-x describe-mode’ in an annotation buffer for mode-specific
     help
   • The header-line always shows available commands and current status
   • Use sexp editing mode to inspect annotation data structures
     directly
   • Check threading information in the annotation list (‘M-s l’) for
     debugging
